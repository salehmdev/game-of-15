# Game of 15

Website that lets users play “Game of 15”. Users move tiles to solve a puzzle until the tiles are in the correct order.

This was a starter project that was created to familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

P.S. this was finished 10/28/2016, before I learned about Git 😅.
